Power Armor Enhancements (PAE) allows the player to make several modifications to their power armor which makes Power Armor-focused playthroughs more rewarding.  PAE requires no official DLC plugins but is compatible with all of them and will not conflict with other plugins thanks to Inject-Tec http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21530.

Features:
•	Augment all arm and torso pieces with pockets, increasing carry weight
•	Augment all leg pieces, increasing movement speed
•	Multiple ranks of most mods, allowing lower level characters access to PAE features
•	Unique set-specific mods for non-raider armors matching the theme of the implied main story faction association of that armor set
•	Balanced material and perk requirements for each of PAE's mod options
•	Power Armor Repair kits for both individual parts and entire suits
•	All non-unique mods are truly generic and will work on any Power Armor parts from any plugin (provided they have the correct mod attachment points)
•	All mods and repair parts have been added to the Atom Cats Power Armor vendor

As of v1.2.0, the non-unique mods already attached to Power Armor pieces will remain in effect but are no longer craftable due to how they were made truly generic.  Conversely, if removed, the resulting loose mod can be applied to any Power Armor piece regardless of the armor set it belongs to.
Generic mods:
•	Leg pieces for faster movement speed
•	Arm and chest pieces for increased carry weight
•	Light and Heavy materials for every piece which can make having a primary and a backup set of armor more viable for longer excursions.
Set-specific mods:
•	T-45 (Minutemen) Arms can be modified to increase reload speed
•	T-51 (Railroad) Legs can be modified to decrease detection chance
•	T-60 (BoS) Torso can be modified to increase physical, radiation, and energy resistance
•	X-01 (Institute) Helmet can be modified to increase damage with laser and plasma weapons

Repair kits:
•	All Power Armor pieces in a set (excepting the Torso) require the same components to repair which means there are generic piece and torso kits for each armor set
•	There are also All-in-One packages of all the kits required to repair an entire set of Power Armor which can be dropped and unpacked to produce five of the generic kits and one torso kit for that armor set
•	Both the part and AiO kits can be crafted at the Armorsmith Workbench provided by AWKCR
•	Appear in the Junk inventory tab because they scrap down to the components required to repair the armor piece they correspond to
•	Be careful not to scrap them until you’re ready and consider storing them in their All-in-One forms or else having a companion carry them
•	Are useful for longer excursions along with the light material options to make carrying spare Power Armor parts and repairing in the field more viable
•	Individual part kits have a weight and sell value benefit over the amount of scrap they break down in to and the AiO kits have the same benefits over the individual part kits.
